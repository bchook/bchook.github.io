	<h1>about</h1>
	<p> Colour Pot was born from my passion to create what is imagined. Just add colour + glitter - the possibilities are endless! With fabulous face painting designs, for boys and girls, I am always up to date with the latest ideas and techniques. I will have great fun with your children and can come dressed in costume to suit the style of your party. Not just for the little ones, why not book Colour Pot for your Festival face and body painting. Amazing eye designs, glitter make up and body art. Corporate event? I will ensure that all your guests leave your event creatively painted after having had a great face painting experience.</p>

	<p>I use all non-toxic....etc.</p>

	<p> Whatever the occasion, it always looks better in COLOUR</p>
